        <h2>My Journey in <span class="coding">Coding</span></h2>

        <h4>Discover how I embarked on the path of coding, the challenges I faced, and the
            satisfaction of solving complex problems.</h4>

        <img src="./images/coding.jpg" alt="Coding" class="other-images">

        <p>Coding has always been something I love. From learning the basics to tackling complex problems, my
            journey has had its ups and downs. Whether I'm building projects or fixing errors, there's nothing quite
            like the excitement of making my code work. The sense of accomplishment that comes from solving a
            challenging problem is truly rewarding. Each project I complete not only improves my skills but also
            fuels my passion for learning more. Coding isn't just a hobby; it's a way of thinking and creating that
            continues to inspire me every day.</p>

        <p> Here's a video showing one of my recent coding projects:</p>

        <h2>Passion for <span class="cricket-anime">Cricket</span></h2>

        <h4> A glimpse into my love for cricket, the sport that has been a constant source of excitement and teamwork
            in my life.</h4>

        <img src="./images/cricket.jpg" alt="Cricket" class="other-images">

        <p>Cricket has always been more than just a game for me; it's a way of life. From playing in the streets as
            a child to joining college tournaments, cricket has shown me how important teamwork, strategy, and
            staying calm under pressure are. Every match brings a new challenge, and each victory feels even better
            when shared with friends. Cricket has taught me to work well with others, think quickly, and enjoy the
            excitement of the game. It's a sport that brings joy and teaches valuable lessons, both on and off the
            field.</p>

        <h4>Reliving the memorable trips with friends, exploring new places, and creating memories that will last a
            lifetime.</h4>

        <p>Traveling with friends is one of the most fulfilling experiences. Recently, we explored Visakhapatnam and
            Araku, where we visited serene beaches, sacred temples, and indulged in delicious local cuisine. The
            laughter, adventure, and shared moments made this trip unforgettable.</p>
